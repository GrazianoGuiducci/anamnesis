# Navigation Map — Rapid Orientation

> After compaction or new session, use this map to know
> WHERE to find WHAT. Don't re-read everything — follow the path you need.

## Questions → Paths

### "What was I doing?"
→ `active_reasoning.md` — Intent Core + Causal Chain
→ `active_context.md` — Lagrangian snapshot (git state, attractor, momentum)
→ Todo list (in-session)

### "WHY was I doing it that way?"
→ `active_reasoning.md` — Bifurcations, Decisions, KLI
→ This is the semantic channel — the only one that carries the "why" across compaction.

### "What happened in previous sessions?"
→ `[your session log path]` — narrative history

### "What's in queue / dormant?"
→ `active_reasoning.md` — Vault section
→ `[your backlog path]` — structured backlog

### "I need to make an architectural decision — where do I find guidance?"
→ `[your design docs / principles path]`

## Post-Recovery Read Order (recommended)

1. **active_reasoning.md** — why you were reasoning that way (~30 sec)
2. **Todo list** — what you were doing operationally (~5 sec)
3. **Persistent memory** — project context (auto-loaded, scan directives) (~10 sec)
4. **This map** — where to find the rest if needed (on-demand)
